        <div class="story">

            On their first date, Scott and Libby met at The Red Hat. Scott forgot his ID, so he ate pretzels and drank Pepsis while Libby drank beers and rambled about how stressed she was at work. After several more adventures to the Beantown Pub, Mystery Science Theater 3000, standup comedy shows, and Red Sox games, they started falling in love! Libby loved Scott's sense of humor and easy going nature. Scott loved Libby's goofiness and "you're so smarts"-ness.  In February of 2018, Libby won Valentine's Day by asking Scott to move in with her in East Boston. He said yes! In July, Scott asked Libby if he could take her out to a surprise lunch and adventure on the one-year anniversary of their first date. They went to Craft and then walked to Piers Park, Libby's favorite place in the city, where Scott PROPOSED! She said, "I knew it!" And then she said yes. Scott was very patient all day while Libby tried to figure out his secret plans. Now, Scott and Libby are excitedly planning their wedding ceremony and their new married life together. They're very happy to have you in their lives and look forward to celebrating their joy alongside you on their big day!
